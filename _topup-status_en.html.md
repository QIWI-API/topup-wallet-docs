# Transaction Status Check {#status}

###### [Edit on GitHub](https://github.com/QIWI-API/topup-wallet-doc/blob/master/_topup-status_en.html.md)

When registered in QIWI Wallet system, a payment passes through a set of states with different statuses. Each status is specified by its unique numeric identifier. Payment processing is treated as complete when it reaches a final status. All possible status codes are listed in [Payment statuses](#statuses).

To check if a payment is completed successfully, the Agent’s system should use this API method to query payment status in QIWI Wallet, until a final status code, successful or unsuccessful, is received.

<aside class="notice">The request provides current payment status. Repeating request for the same payment should be used no more than once in 10 minutes.</aside>

## Request format


### Request parameters

~~~xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <request>
    <request-type>pay</request-type>
    <extra name="password">XXXXXX</extra>
    <terminal-id>123</terminal-id>
    <status>
      <payment>
        <transaction-number>12345678</transaction-number>
        <to>
          <account-number>79181234567</account-number>
        </to>
      </payment>
    </status>
  </request>

Tag|Description
-|-
*request*| A grouping tag. The child tags contain payment data
*request-type* | Request type (payment status check is the same as top-up request: `pay`)
*terminal-id* | Agent ID in QIWI Wallet system
*extra name="password"* | Agent’s password in QIWI Wallet system
*status*|A grouping tag. The tag contains child tags with payments data to check their status (one or more `payment` tag)
*payment*|A grouping tag containing single payment data to check its status
*transaction-number* | Transaction number generated by the Agent’s system and specified in [top-up request](#payment). Together with Agent ID, transaction number uniquely identifies the payment in QIWI Wallet system. Transaction number always stays immutable within payment lifetime.
*to*|A grouping tag with payment information
*to/account-number* | QIWI Wallet user ID, i.e. the mobile phone number in international format

## Response format

In case of non-fatal [error](#tech_error) or non-final [payment status](#statuses) received in response to the request, the Agent’s system should repeat the request.

[Fatal errors](#tech_error) mean that sending a secondary request with the same parameters will result in the same error. Fatal errors are often caused by invalid configuration and require manual intervention. In case of fatal error, the Agent’s system may either keep repeating requests, or pause repeating the request until the configuration is corrected. Agent’s system needs not to deny payment as transaction status is unknown on request processing error. Transaction status information is inaccessible in case of these errors, so the Agent should not denies the payment on its side.

In case of network error (connection or response timeout) or HTTP error (HTTP status code other than `200`, or empty HTTP response), incorrect XML-documents (no required tag/attribute) the Agent’s system should repeat the request. Transaction status information is inaccessible in case of these errors, so the Agent should not reject the payment on its side.

Response data:

Tag|Description|Attributes
--------|------|---------
*response*	| A grouping tag|No
*payment* | Details of the checked payment. When several payments status check is requested, response contains corresponding `payment` tags. When payment in the request is not found in QIWI Wallet system, corresponding `payment` tag will be absent in the response. You have to repeat payment status check request for that payment.| `status` – [payment status](#statuses) in QIWI Wallet system;
 | | `txn_id` – transaction ID in QIWI Wallet system;
 | | `transaction-number` – transaction number in the Agent’s system;
 | | `result-code` – payment processing error [code](#error);
 | | `final-status` – logical flag indicating if payment status is final;
 | |  `fatal-error` - logical flag indicating if payment processing error is fatal;
 | | `txn-date` – date and time when the payment was accepted by QIWI Wallet system;
*balances*|A grouping tag. The child tags are current balances of the Agent's active accounts in QIWI Wallet system |No
*balances/balance* | Balance of the Agent's account| `code` - currency of the Agent's account (numeric code of currency according  to ISO 4217)
